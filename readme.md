emsg_id3_decode_delay.py

Apple HLS ‚Üí decode in-band ID3 + compute live ‚Äúnext track‚Äù delay

This script listens to an Apple HLS stream (fMP4/MP4 segments), extracts timed ID3 metadata carried inside emsg boxes (and the Apple UUID variant), converts PTS ‚Üí wall-clock, and logs when the next track should be shown in your UI.

It‚Äôs built for cases where a NowPlaying feed flips before the audio actually changes. Instead of guessing, this reads the timed metadata embedded in the stream and computes a per-event delay.

‚∏ª

What it does
	1.	Playlist handling
	‚Ä¢	Opens the HLS URL you pass in.
	‚Ä¢	If the URL is a master playlist, it automatically picks the variant (e.g. your FLAC rendition).
	2.	Segment parsing
	‚Ä¢	Downloads .m4s segments.
	‚Ä¢	Parses MP4 boxes and finds timed-metadata carriers:
	‚Ä¢	emsg v1 with scheme_id_uri = https://developer.apple.com/streaming/emsg-id3
	‚Ä¢	(and the Apple UUID ID3 carrier if present)
	3.	ID3 decoding
	‚Ä¢	Pulls the ID3 payload and decodes frames with Mutagen (TIT2, TPE1, TALB, etc.).
	4.	PTS ‚Üí wall-clock delay
	‚Ä¢	Uses the first ID3 as a baseline: (base_pts, base_wall_time).
	‚Ä¢	For each subsequent ID3 with PTS:

predicted_time  = base_wall_time + (pts - base_pts)
delay_seconds   = predicted_time - now()


	‚Ä¢	That delay_seconds is the time until the new track should be shown.

	5.	[NEXT] flag
	‚Ä¢	When (title, artist, album) changes from the last announced values, the line is annotated with [NEXT] so you can key off true track changes.
	6.	CSV log
	‚Ä¢	Appends a row to id3_events.csv with: WallClock,AbsPTS,RelPTS,DeltaSincePrev,Title,Artist,Album,Source.

Example output

[ID3][emsg] WallClock=22:16:20 | PTS=203094.613 | Delay=11.585s | Title=Ride With You | Artist=Blackfoot | Album=Vertical Smiles
[ID3][emsg] WallClock=22:16:40 | PTS=203116.715 | Delay=10.653s | Title=It Ain't Over (Til It's Over) | Artist=No Love Lost | Album=Last Call [NEXT]

	‚Ä¢	PTS: presentation timestamp on the stream‚Äôs global timeline (does not reset per song).
	‚Ä¢	Delay: how long from now until the audio for that metadata should begin.

‚∏ª

Why you‚Äôd use this
	‚Ä¢	Your NowPlaying feed updates early and you need the true switch time.
	‚Ä¢	You want a simple console/CSV signal to integrate into tooling, dashboards, or another writer.
	‚Ä¢	Your encoder follows the Apple timed metadata approach (ID3 in emsg / UUID).

Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Python 3.10+
	‚Ä¢	pip install the deps:

requests
m3u8
mutagen

(They‚Äôre typically listed in requirements.txt in this repo.)

‚∏ª

Quick start

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run against your HLS playlist (master or variant)
python emsg_id3_decode_delay.py https://your-host/path/stream.m3u8

	‚Ä¢	Lines print to stdout as events arrive.
	‚Ä¢	A running CSV log is written next to the script as id3_events.csv.

‚∏ª

How delay is computed (details)
	‚Ä¢	Baseline: first ID3 seen ‚Üí base_pts and base_wall_time = now().
	‚Ä¢	Subsequent event:
rel_pts = pts - base_pts
predicted_wall = base_wall_time + rel_pts
delay = predicted_wall - now()
	‚Ä¢	This avoids relying on wall-clock from the server and stays stable even if PTS is a large number (streams run for days).

‚∏ª

Notes & gotchas
	‚Ä¢	PTS looks huge? Totally normal; it‚Äôs a monotonic clock across the entire broadcast.
	‚Ä¢	Duplicate metadata lines: some encoders emit repeated ID3 every N seconds for the same track. You‚Äôll see multiple lines until the next track. Use [NEXT] to detect the real change.
	‚Ä¢	No ID3 showing up? Use a segment probe (or ffprobe) to ensure your encoder emits emsg with the Apple ID3 scheme/UUID. Some stacks only inject timed metadata for HLS-TS, not fMP4.
	‚Ä¢	Network time: The script uses the host wall clock; significant skew will bias computed delays.

‚∏ª

Troubleshooting
	‚Ä¢	No output
	‚Ä¢	Verify the URL is reachable and returns HLS (not a 302, not DRM).
	‚Ä¢	If it‚Äôs a master playlist, ensure there‚Äôs a valid audio-only variant.
	‚Ä¢	Decoding errors
	‚Ä¢	You may see one-off lines like ID3v2.xx not supported if an encoder emits oddities; later events typically parse fine.
	‚Ä¢	Delay jitter
	‚Ä¢	Small fluctuations (<1‚Äì2 s) can come from segment fetch timings; let it run and prefer the latest line per track.
